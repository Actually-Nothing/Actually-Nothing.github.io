        When the sun goes down then keep in mind <br>
        that it is what it is. <br>
        The homework you forgot to do is now irrelevant,<br>
        Your wife who cheated on you today is now irrelevant,<br>
        The food that tasted so good this morning is now irrelevant.<br>
        Does that sound bad?<br>
        Why?<br>
        Everything will pass and everything good and beautiful will be neither a burden nor a pleasure for you.<br>
        But at this moment you can make it good or bad, it's all in your hands.<br>
        Everything that is dark can gain light through your hand<br>
        and everything that is already light can become dark again through you.<br>
        Everything is controlled by your perspective and you decide which one you take.<br><br>

        Why see it that way?<br><br>

        ''Oh man, I forgot to do my homework! Damn, I'm really going to get in trouble for this : ( ''<br><br>

        If you can see it that way too<br><br>

        ''I forgot my homework but I'm not going to let these bad emotions get to me and just enjoy the day! : )''<br><br>

        That sounds weird ?<br>
        Maybe.<br>
        But you could enjoy beautiful little and big things instead of always being preoccupied with tiring thoughts and activities.<br><br>

        Don't get upset about the street noise on the way to work, but be happy about the flower you saw on the way.<br>
