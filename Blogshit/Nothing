    At the end of the day, even your life, <br>
    <b>reading this will have made no difference.</b> <br>
    You can grieve about it, <br>
    be confused or scared or <b>accept it</b>. <br>
    At the end of life, your friends, family,<br>
    ideals and values will <b>die</b> with you.<br>
    At least if we assume that you die and there<br>
    is no higher being that judges you and decides<br>
    whether hell or heaven,<br>
    rebirth or eternal life is your future.<br>
    <b>Then nothing will happen.</b><br>
    So what? It's not so bad.<br>
    You probably can't think about it anyway.<br>
    It will be the peace that the living can<br>
    never achieve.<br>
    Neither negative nor positive will ever<br>
    come your way again.<br>
    Boring?<br>
    Maybe.<br>
    <b>You probably won't be able to think aboutit anyway.</b><br>
    This article is just for you to think about it.<br><br>

    <b>Read a good book.</b><br>
    Eat a tasty meal.<br>
    Take a closer look at your environment.<br>
    Watch a good movie.<br>
    Play an entertaining computer game.<br><br>

    All this is <b>nothing</b>, do you understand?<br><br>

    Nevertheless, <b>nothing can be fun</b><br>
